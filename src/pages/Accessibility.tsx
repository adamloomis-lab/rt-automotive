      <p>
        {company.name} is committed to making our website accessible and welcoming to everyone,
        including people with disabilities. We want every customer to be able to find our services,
        hours, and location, and to request service, with ease.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA. These
        guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with a wide range of
        disabilities. We build this Site with semantic markup, descriptive alternative text for
        images, keyboard-navigable controls, and color choices intended to meet contrast standards.
      </p>

      <h2>Ongoing Effort</h2>
      <p>
        Accessibility is an ongoing effort. We periodically review the Site and work to improve it.
        Some content provided by third parties (such as embedded maps or social media) may not be
        fully under our control, and we encourage those providers to maintain accessible
        experiences.
      </p>

      <h2>Known Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        Despite our efforts, some portions of the Site may not yet be fully accessible. If you
        encounter a barrier, please let us know, your feedback helps us improve.
      </p>
